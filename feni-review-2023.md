title: "L10 FeNi: a promising material for next generation permanent magnets"
journal: "Critical Reviews in Solid State and Materials Sciences"
abstract: "The paper reviews L10 FeNi as a candidate for permanent magnets due to its high magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic saturation. Challenges in bulk synthesis due to slow Ni diffusion are discussed, along with artificial synthesis techniques."
methodology: "Literature review and experimental analysis of synthetic and natural L10 FeNi using various characterization techniques (XRD, MBE, TEM, Mössbauer spectroscopy, DSC, etc.). Comparison of natural (meteoritic) and synthetic samples, along with discussions on thermodynamic stability and kinetics."
strengths_limitations: "Strengths: Extensive review covering physical, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of L10 FeNi. In-depth comparison of synthesis methods and properties. Limitations: Challenges in large-scale synthesis due to slow Ni diffusion and difficulty in achieving high ordering in artificial samples."
sample_size: "Various natural meteoritic samples, thin films, nanoparticles, and bulk synthesized L10 FeNi materials"
key_findings: "L10 FeNi has high magnetic anisotropy (~1.35MJ/m³), Curie temperature of 823K, and promising coercivity (0.05-0.178T). Artificial synthesis methods include high-energy ball milling, nitrogen insertion, and electrochemical processes. Meteorites contain a higher volume of L10 FeNi (60-90%) compared to artificial methods (~8-10%)."
notes: "Artificial synthesis methods like the NITE (Nitrogen Insertion and Topotactic Extraction) method show promise for scalable production. MBE-grown L10 FeNi thin films show better control over ordering and magnetic properties"
remarks: "L10 FeNi could be a rare-earth-free alternative for permanent magnets but needs further development for large-scale applications. Further research into additive manufacturing techniques and field-assisted processing is recommended."
